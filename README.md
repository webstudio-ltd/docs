## Why Webstudio Docs?

We're a web agency that got tired of paying $65/month per site for GitBook. So we built our own docs platform and open-sourced it.

**The result:**

- **4 files** — `index.php`, `api.php`, `auth.php`, `.htaccess`. That's the entire platform.
- **No database** — everything is stored as JSON files on your server.
- **No build process** — no npm, no webpack, no config files. Upload and done.
- **Self-hosted** — your server, your data, your domain. No vendor lock-in.
- **Free forever** — MIT license, no usage limits, no per-user pricing.

We use it in production for our own client projects. It works. It's fast. And it costs nothing.

### 🔗 Live Demo

Try it yourself: **[docs.web-studio.sk](https://docs.web-studio.sk)** — password: `DemoPassword@123`

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Requirements:** Any PHP 7.4+ hosting with write permissions. That's it.

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/webstudio-ltd/docs.git

# 2. Upload to your PHP server
#    index.php + api.php + auth.php + .htaccess

# 3. Open in browser → set your admin password → start writing
```

No `npm install`. No environment variables. No database migrations. No Docker. Just upload four files and you have a documentation site.

### 🔜 Premium Edition (Coming Soon)

We're building a **Premium version** with advanced features for teams and businesses — AI-powered writing tools, integrations, analytics, and more.

**Pricing model:** One-time purchase. No monthly fees. No per-user charges. Every purchase directly funds the continued development of the free open-source version.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### File Structure

```
your-docs-site/
├── index.php      ← Main application (frontend + OG tag generation)
├── api.php        ← Backend API (pages, spaces, images, settings)
├── auth.php       ← Authentication (setup wizard, login, sessions)
├── .htaccess      ← Security (blocks /data/ from direct access)
├── data/          ← Auto-created on first run
│   ├── auth.json      ← Hashed password (bcrypt)
│   ├── settings.json  ← Site configuration
│   ├── spaces.json    ← Space definitions
│   └── pages/         ← One JSON file per page
└── images/        ← Auto-created
    └── og/            ← Auto-generated social sharing images
```

### Adding a Language

1. Open `index.php`, find the `TRANSLATIONS` object
2. Copy the entire `en: { ... }` block
3. Rename to your language code (e.g. `de`, `fr`, `es`)
4. Translate the values
5. Add the option to the language `<select>` in the settings HTML
6. Submit a PR — we'd love to include it!

### Nginx Users

`.htaccess` is Apache-only. For Nginx, add this to your server block:

```nginx
location /data/ { deny all; return 403; }
location ~ \.json$ { deny all; return 403; }
```
